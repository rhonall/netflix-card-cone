Scrimba Weekly Challenge - Nextflix Card Cone 

I have fun doing this week challenge. 
I used Font Awesome Icons instead of the images provided by Scrimba as I found those images are a bit too bold.

I have troubled on putting a round circle border on the the icons, but I found the solution online. Then I have to move individual icon to the position that I'm happy. The codes are not as clean and short as I want but I have tried my best.
